## System Components

<a name="backend"></a>

### 2. Backend

- Node.js: We will use Node.js for the backend to handle the logic of our application.

<a name="Database and ORM"></a>

### 3. Database & ORM

- MySQL & Sequelize: We will utilize MySQL as the database management system to store information about users, plans, events and selections. We will utilize Sequelize as the ORM to manage our interactions with the database.

<a name="Database Setup"></a>

### Database Setup

Before you start, make sure you have MySQL installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [the official MySQL site](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/).

To set up the MySQL database, follow these steps:

1. Open your command line interface and start MySQL with this command:

   ```
   mysql -u root -p
   ```
     
2. Create the "planner" database with this command:
   
   ```
   CREATE DATABASE planner;
   ```
3. Connect to the new database with this command:
   
   ```
   use planner;
   ```

Now, you're ready to use your "planner" database.

<a name="Setting up your env"></a>

### Setting up your .env

Open up the repository in your preferred code editor and create a .env file in the project root directory. In this .env file add the following:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_NAME=planner
DB_PASS= [your db password]

SUPER_SECRET=shhhhh

PUSHER_APP_ID=
PUSHER_KEY=
PUSHER_SECRET=
cluster=
```

Now create a .env file in the project root directory. In this .env file add the following:

```
VITE_PUSHER_KEY=
```

*Don't forget to create your .gitignore file and add .env (in both the root directory and client directory)!*

<a name="Adding Pusher"></a>

### Adding Pusher

To populate the Pusher details in your .env files:

1. Navigate to [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) and create an account.
2. Once logged in you should see your [Pusher dashboard](https://dashboard.pusher.com/). Here you need to click "manage" on the channels card.
3. Now you can click "Create app" in the top right of the page and fill in the form:
    - Fill in a name for the app (we used "its-a-date")
    - Select a cluster (we used eu)
    - You don't need to tick the box for "Create apps for multiple environments?"
    - Frontend: React
    - Backend: Node.js
4. Navigate to "App Keys" in the left nav and copy the keys you have generated into the .env files that you've just created.
